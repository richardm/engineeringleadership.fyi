## Summary

Teams spend disproportionate time on trivial issues.

## Origin

Parkinson, 1957.

## Still Applicable?

## Context Notes:

Coined by C. Northcote Parkinson. Describes how a team will spend more time on simple, low-impact decisions (like the color of a bike shed) than complex ones (like a nuclear reactor).
