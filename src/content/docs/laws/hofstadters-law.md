title: Hofstadter’s Law
---

## Summary

It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.

## Origin

Douglas Hofstadter, Gödel, Escher, Bach (1979).

## Still Applicable?

Sadly, yes.

## Context Notes:

This self-referential law captures the inherent difficulty of software estimation. It reminds leaders to build in buffer time and not to anchor plans too tightly to optimistic projections.
