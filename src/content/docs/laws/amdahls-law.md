## Summary

The speedup of a system is limited by the portion that cannot be parallelized.

## Still Applicable?

Yes, in both computing and team efficiency.

## Context Notes:

This performance principle applies equally to parallel computing and organizational throughput. Even if most tasks can be scaled horizontally, a single bottleneck in the critical path can dominate the system's speed. Identify and resolve serial chokepoints.
