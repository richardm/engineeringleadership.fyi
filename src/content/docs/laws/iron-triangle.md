title: The Iron Triangle (Project Management Triangle)
---

## Summary

You can optimize for speed, cost, or quality — pick two.

## Origin

Widely used in project management; precise origin unknown but popularized in the mid-to-late 20th century.

## Still Applicable?

Yes — but requires nuance. Especially relevant in cross-functional planning and stakeholder alignment.

## Additional Detail

The Iron Triangle (sometimes called the Triple Constraint) expresses the tradeoffs inherent in every project: you can deliver something **fast**, **cheap**, or **good** — but not all three at once. Trying to do so usually results in failure, burnout, or hidden costs.

Engineering leaders use this model to guide delivery and planning conversations, helping stakeholders make informed tradeoffs. For example, delivering fast and at high quality will usually be expensive; delivering cheap and fast will almost certainly compromise quality.

However, many experienced engineers challenge the triangle’s implication that quality always slows you down. In practice, investing in **quality** — through automated testing, clean code, and reliable infrastructure — often **increases throughput over time**. High-quality systems require fewer patches, introduce fewer bugs, and are easier to evolve. In this sense:

Books like _Accelerate_ and principles from Lean Software Development demonstrate that teams who build quality in from the start tend to move faster, not slower, as complexity grows.

The Iron Triangle is still a useful communication tool, especially under deadline pressure. But modern software leaders must also educate stakeholders that short-term cuts to quality often increase long-term cost and slow delivery later in the lifecycle.
