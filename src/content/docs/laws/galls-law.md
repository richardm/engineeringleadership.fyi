title: Gall's Law
---

## Summary

A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.

## Origin

John Gall, Systemantics (1975).

## Still Applicable?

Yes, especially in startups and platform evolution.

## Context Notes

Gallâ€™s Law supports iterative, evolutionary design. Attempting to build a complex system from scratch often fails due to unknowns. Starting with something simple and learning from production use enables robust complexity to emerge organically.
