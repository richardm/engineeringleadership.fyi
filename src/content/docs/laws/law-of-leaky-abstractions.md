title: Law of Leaky Abstractions
description: Also konwn as Spolsky's Law
---

## Summary

All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.

## Origin

Joel Spolsky, blog post “The Law of Leaky Abstractions” (2002).

## Still Applicable?

Yes. Especially critical when teams build on top of frameworks or cloud services.

## Context Notes:

No abstraction perfectly hides the complexity beneath it. This law encourages engineers and leaders to retain a working knowledge of underlying systems, even when leveraging higher-level tools. It’s particularly relevant in cloud architecture, where cost or latency implications may leak through abstraction boundaries.
