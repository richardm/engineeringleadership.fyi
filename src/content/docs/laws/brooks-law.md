title: Brooks' Law
---

## Summary

Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later, due to increased communication paths `n(n–1)/2`.

## Origin

Introduced by Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month (1975).

## Still Applicable?

Yes, especially in projects with high coordination overhead.

## Context Notes:

Brooks’s Law highlights the nonlinear cost of communication and onboarding. As more people are added to a late-stage project, the coordination overhead increases, which often slows progress even further. This is a critical reminder to plan resourcing early and to avoid knee-jerk headcount increases late in a timeline.
