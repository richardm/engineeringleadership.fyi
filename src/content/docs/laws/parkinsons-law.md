title: Parkinsonâ€™s Law
---

## Summary

Work expands to fill the time available for its completion.

## Origin

Cyril Northcote Parkinson, The Economist (1955).

## Still Applicable?

Yes. Drives a need for timeboxing, clear goals, and outcome-based planning.

## Context Notes

This law serves as a warning about open-ended work. Teams without time pressure often drift into gold-plating or over-engineering. Effective engineering leaders use timeboxing and constraints to drive focus and urgency
