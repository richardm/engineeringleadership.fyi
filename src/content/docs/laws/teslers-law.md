title: Teslerâ€™s Law (Law of Conservation of Complexity)
---

## Summary

Every application has an inherent complexity. You can only shift it around.

## Origin

Larry Tesler, circa 1980s.

## Still Applicable?

Yes. Especially relevant in UX, platform design, and API ergonomics.

## Context Notes:

Bruce Tognazzini credited this to Larry Tesler, a pioneer of human-computer interaction. The core idea is that you can't eliminate complexity, only move it between system and user.
