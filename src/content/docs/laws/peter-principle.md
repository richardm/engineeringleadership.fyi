title: The Peter Principle
---

## Summary

In a hierarchy, people tend to be promoted to their level of incompetence.

## Still Applicable?

Yes. Especially relevant in engineering orgs without dual career ladders.

## Origin

Laurence J. Peter and Raymond Hull, The Peter Principle (1969).

## Additional Detail

The Peter Principle describes a common failure in promotion systems: employees are rewarded for excellent performance in one role by being promoted into a new role for which they are unqualified â€” and where they remain.

For engineering managers, this highlights the importance of distinguishing between technical excellence and leadership aptitude. Not every high-performing IC will enjoy (or succeed in) management. Career tracks should support growth without forcing people into roles that don't align with their strengths.

Engineering leaders should also support coaching, mentorship, and feedback loops to ensure that promotions are based on demonstrated readiness, not just tenure or performance in unrelated roles.
