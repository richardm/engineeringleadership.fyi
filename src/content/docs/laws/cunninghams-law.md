title: Cunningham’s Law
---

## Summary

The best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it’s to post the wrong answer.

## Still Applicable?

Humorously, yes. Especially in forums and collaborative knowledge bases.

## Context Notes:

Attributed to Ward Cunningham (creator of the first wiki), though he disclaims coining it. Reflects the social dynamic that people are more motivated to correct misinformation than to answer neutrally.
