title: Dunbar’s Number
---

## Summary

Humans can maintain about 150 stable social relationships.

## Origin

British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, 1990s.

## Still Applicable?

Yes. Influences optimal team/org size and communication design.

## Context Notes:

Used in org design to determine when to split teams or units. Exceeding Dunbar’s number often results in decreased communication quality and cohesion. Many companies split business units or departments once they hit this threshold.
