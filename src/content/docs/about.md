The **Engineering Leadership Handbook** is a structured, objective, and community-curated reference for people leading in technical environments.

It exists to help current and aspiring leaders make better decisions, communicate more clearly, and operate from a foundation of shared understanding — not intuition alone.

This isn’t a personal blog. It’s not prescriptive. It’s not focused on any one company or school of thought.

Instead, it’s a modular framework of:

- ✅ Universal truths about leadership, human behavior, and systems thinking
- ✅ Widely cited laws and patterns observed in organizations
- ✅ Tenets that articulate value trade-offs between competing priorities
- ✅ Practical leadership behaviors ("practices") that show how principles are implemented
- ✅ A shared library of values drawn from real companies and leadership cultures
- ✅ References, books, and case studies from real teams and leaders

## Who It’s For

- **Staff+ Engineers** who influence others without formal authority
- **New and aspiring Engineering Managers** seeking clarity and confidence
- **Directors, VPs, and CTOs** who want to document, teach, or challenge leadership beliefs
- **Leadership coaches and community contributors** who want a structured way to engage

## Why It’s Structured This Way

Leadership content is often scattered, opinionated, or vague. This project organizes it into distinct types of content — each with clear expectations:

| Type           | Purpose                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Principles** | Foundational ideas — either universal or contextual — that underpin effective leadership |
| **Tenets**     | Explicit value trade-offs used to guide decisions when priorities compete                |
| **Laws**       | Widely observed patterns in systems and organizations, often named and cited             |
| **Practices**  | Repeatable leadership behaviors that implement a principle or reflect a tenet            |
| **Values**     | Common ideals used to shape team culture — not endorsements, but references              |
| **Books**      | Curated summaries and external reviews of important works in technical leadership        |

Each type of content is clearly labeled, versioned, and open to contribution.

## Contributing

If you’d like to suggest a new principle, tenet, or practice — or add your perspective to an existing entry — start by reading our [Contribution Guide](/contributing/).

You can also link your own articles or case studies from principle pages under “Community Commentary.”

We’re especially interested in:

- Leadership case studies
- Alternate practices that implement the same principle
- Counterarguments and critiques — with citations
- Historical sources of laws or cultural values
