## What You’ll Find Here

### The Foundation

These are universal in nature and provide the foundation for all other layers.

<CardGrid>
  <div class="disabled">
    <Card title="First Principles" icon="lightbulb">
      <p>
        Universal truths about leadership, systems thinking, and human behavior
        — foundational ideas that guide how great leaders operate.

    </Card>
  </div>
  <Card title="Laws" icon="document">
    <p>
      Well-known patterns and system laws observed in organizations, from
      Conway's Law to Goodhart's Law — each grounded in research or real-world
      experience.

  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Context-Specific Guidance

These are context-specific and provide guidance for how to proceed in specific situations.

<CardGrid>
  <div class="disabled">
    <Card title="Values" icon="heart">
      <p>
        Values are the abstract ideas we hold most dear. Values inform our
        beliefs and guide our actions. Principles and tenets flow from our
        values and describe how we put them into practice. Every company chooses
        and prioritizes its values, but the set of distinct values to draw from
        is finite.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section captures the vast majority of common values with reasons
        for and against. As values are context-specific, these are meant as a
        resource for you to draw from when deciding your own organization's
        values rather than a recommendation.
      </p>
      {/* <LinkButton href="/values/">Explore values →</LinkButton> */}
      <span class="coming-soon">Coming soon!</span>
    </Card>
  </div>
  <div class="disabled">
    <Card title="Tenets" icon="scale">
      <p>
        Great tenets provide clear direction for how to proceed when forced to
        choose between competing values. They provide a clear guidance for what
        your organization should prioritize. As tenets are based in values and
        context-specific needs, you must choose the tenets which are
        most-applicable to your organization's needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        While tenets are not universal, many common tenets have stood the test
        of time. Here we attempt to present a balanced view as well as
        guidelines of when to consider adopting them for your organization.

## Designed for engineering leaders at all levels

- **Senior+ Engineers** who influence others without formal authority
- **Engineering Managers** seeking clarity and confidence
- **Directors, VPs, and CTOs** who want to document, teach, or challenge leadership beliefs
- **Leadership coaches and community contributors** who want a structured way to engage

## What it is

- A curated set of foundational truths, laws, and principles spanning behavioral psychology, human nature, communication, leadership, management, and engineering.
- A trusted, open resource grounded in universal truths, not opinion.
- A foundation others can cite, disagree with, or expand upon.
- A community-curated reference

## What it's not

- How To's for implementing specific patterns.
- Architecture or low-level code quality advice. This is out of scope, and there
  are many excellent resources for that.

## Why this exists

The Engineering Leadership Handbook exists to help technical leaders:

- Make better decisions by understanding universal and contextual truths
- Communicate more clearly using shared language and documented tradeoffs
- Contribute to a larger body of knowledge without reinventing the wheel
- In particular, this is a resource the project creator wishes existed when they were first learning about leadership
