# The Engineering Leadership Handbook

An **objective, structured, and community-curated reference** for engineering leadership at every level — from Staff+ ICs to first-time managers to seasoned VPs.

---

## 🎯 Vision

The Engineering Leadership Handbook codifies:

- ✅ Universal truths about leadership, human behavior, and systems thinking
- ✅ Widely recognized laws and patterns used in technical organizations (e.g., Conway’s Law, Goodhart’s Law)
- ✅ Contextual but well-reasoned tenets, with tradeoffs and limitations made explicit
- ✅ A shared library of values, practices, and principles drawn from real leaders and teams
- ✅ Curated references, company examples, and case studies — all linked to their sources

> This is not a rulebook. It's a **modular reference** to help leaders make better decisions, communicate clearly, and reflect on their values and practices.

This resource is designed for:

- Senior and Staff+ Engineers taking on informal leadership roles
- First-time and early-career Engineering Managers
